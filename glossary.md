Glossary
======================
This glossary describes the components in the FarmBeats student kit, software tools, and defines some terminology used throughput the setup guide. 


Kit Components
======================

**Raspberry Pi 3B**

A Raspberry Pi is low-cost small form factor computer that can be interfaced with a computer monitor or TV, and standard keyboard and mouse. It can be programmed to perform various task ranging from internet browsing to running complex computation. The Raspberry Pi 3B, is a specific model that has features that vary from other Raspberry Pi models. 

**Grove Shield**

The Grove Pi + Shield is plug-and-play hardware that interfaces with the Raspberry Pi. The Grove Pi has several port connections for sensors (ie. soil moisture, temperature, humidity) for easy data collection. It can be directly connected to a Raspberry Pi using a simple pin connections. 

**SD Card**

A Secure Digital (SD) card, or memory card, is device that can be used to store data. The storage size for SD cards vary. For instance, a 16GB SD card allows for 16 gigabytes of data storage. SD cards can be used to store data such as images, videos, or text files. 

**Ethernet Cable**

An ethernet cable is a type of network cable used to establish internet connections for devices such as PCs, or most commonly known, Wi-Fi routers. There are two type of internet connections, wired and wireless. With an ethernet cable, a wired connection can be established. 

**Grove Soil Moisture Sensor**

The Grove soil moisture sensor can be used to detect the moisture of soil. This specific type of soil sensor is also known as a capacitive soil moisture sensor. It works by measuring the changes in <i>capacitance</i> caused in a <i>dielectric</i>. 

<b>Capacitance:</b> the ratio of change in the electric charge in a system to the change in its electrical potential
<b>Dielectric:</b> having the property of transmitting electric force

In other words, capacitive soil moisture sensors measure the dielectric that is formed by the soil and the water. The soil moisture sensor will output a voltage value corresponding to the moisture content of the soil. When the soil is dry the voltage value will be very low and when the moisture begins to increase the voltage will increase as well. 

**Grove Ambient Temperature Sensor**

The Grove ambient temperature sensor uses a thermistor to measure temperature. A thermistor is an electrical resistor whose resistance is reduced by heating.

<b>Resistor:</b> a component that implements electrical resistance
<b>Electrical Resistance:</b> a measure of its opposition to the flow of electric current. 

For instance, when the temperature is very low the resistance is very high and at high temperatures the resistance is very low. 

**Grove Light Intensity Sensor**

The Grove light intensity sensor detects the presence of light. It uses a photo-resistor that, a light dependent resistor, thatâ€™s resistance changes with respect to light intensity. When light intensity increases the resistance decreases and vice versa for decreasing light intensity. 

Software Tools
=============================

**Windows 10 IoT Core Operating System**

Windows 10 IoT Core is the smallest member of the Windows 10 family that brings
power, security and manageability to the Internet of Things (IoT). It allows
individuals and organizations to create secure devices that can be quickly
provisioned, easily managed, and seamlessly connected to the cloud.

**Azure IoT Central cloud service**

Azure IoT Central is a fully managed Internet of Things (IoT)
Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solution that makes it easy to create products that
connect the physical and digital worlds, monitor, and manage your IoT devices.

**Azure Maps Geospatial Data Browsing**

Add maps, search, routing, and traffic capabilities to your apps with geospatial
services APIs that integrate seamlessly with other Azure tools and services.

Other Terminology
============================

**IP Address**
The Internet Protocol (IP) address is a unique sequence of of numbers seperated by periods (123.456.789) that is used to identify a device that is using the Internet Protocol to communicate on a network. 

**IP Network**
An Internet Protocol (IP) network is a communication network used to send and receive messages between one or more device, such as a computer or in your case, the FarmBeats student kit.
